## ⚡ Fault Domains (FD) & Availability
- **Regions**
  - Choose a region closest to users for lowest latency & highest performance
  - Data Residency & Compliance
  - Service Availability

- **Availability Domains (AD)**
  - Isolated from each other
  - Fault-tolerant (unlikely to fail simultaneously)

- **Fault Domains (FD)**
  - Each AD has 3 fault domains
  - Prevents single point of failure
  - Provides redundancy

- **Disaster Recovery**
  - Region Pairing ensures resilience
  - Extra redundancy across FDs & ADs
