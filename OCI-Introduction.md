Core Infrastructure: Compute, Containers, OS/VMWare, storage, networking

Databases: oracle Databases, Distribute & OSS Databases

AI & DAta: Big data, ai services, generative ai

Governance & Administration: Cloud Ops, Security, Observability

Developer Services: Low code, appdev, infrastrcutre as core

Analytics: business analytics

application: Serverless, app integration, business & Industry SaaS

Fault Domains (FD): Hardware & Infrastructure

Choose a region closest to users for lowest latency and highest performance

Data Residency & Compliance 

Service Availability

Availability Domains: Isolated from each other and fault-tolerant (unlikely to fail simultaneously)

Fault domains: Each availability domain has three FD (not share single point failure)

Extra layers of redundancy from one FD to another

## ⚡ Fault Domains (FD) & Availability
- **Regions**
  - Choose a region closest to users for lowest latency & highest performance
  - Data Residency & Compliance
  - Service Availability

- **Availability Domains (AD)**
  - Isolated from each other
  - Fault-tolerant (unlikely to fail simultaneously)

- **Fault Domains (FD)**
  - Each AD has 3 fault domains
  - Prevents single point of failure
  - Provides redundancy

- **Disaster Recovery**
  - Region Pairing ensures resilience
  - Extra redundancy across FDs & ADs
